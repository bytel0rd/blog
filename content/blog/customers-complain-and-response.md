## Customers Complains And Response

DILTA analytics Marker software which was responsible for school management software that has both an offline and online approach to reach various segments of customers the same services only segmented by the availability of internet connectivity and accessibility.

On 23rd June, one of our customers completely uninstalled our offline software from their computer. A background into the situation was that few months before the removal, the computer had been attacked by a computer virus so they had to restore and backup their entire data. The stability of the windows installation or repair performed was as unstable as marker was also unstable running on it. I restored their data and synchronized their data online with the inbuilt synchronization feature.

The system got reformatted again losing all their data and the windows executable itself. We sent a link for the download and their license key but they requested an onsite technical support instead, since we have been offering that before but the constraints of distance made it a challenge.

We stopped thinking about a remote way to solve the problem and the focus was on how to provide an on-site tech support. The question was changed before we could even act instead of us, just directing them back to the synchronization feature to pull back their data online.

## Lessons Learnt:

-   Always try to take a step back to re-evaluate the problem before accepting a solution.

-   Always explain backup & maintenance features properly and design them with a concrete feedback loop.

-   Always minimize or rather afford solutions that would require on-site tech support to fix. (It's not scalable).
